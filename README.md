# Amabilis Bank ![Bank Icon](https://github.com/EmediongFrancis/Amabilis-Bank/blob/main/assets/Bank.png)

Amabilis Bank is the backend service of a basic banking system built with PostgreSQL, Golang, and Docker. This bank will provide APIs for the frontend to:
- Create and manage accounts:
  - Accounts will be composed of owner&rsquo;s name, account balance, and banking currency.
- Record all balance changes:
  - Account entries will be created for every change in balance.
- Perform money transfer:
  - Transfer will be done in a consistent manner within a transaction such that both account balances (sender and receiver) are updated simultaneously if the transfer is successful or none of them are updated in the event of a failed transfer. <br><br>
